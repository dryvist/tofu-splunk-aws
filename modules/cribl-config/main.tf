# Cribl-as-Code config layer.
#
# Sits on top of modules/cribl/ (EC2 Stream leader). Provides declarative
# management of Cribl objects (worker groups, packs, pipelines, routes,
# sources, destinations) via the official criblio Terraform provider.
#
# Gated by var.enable_criblio_config; default false. When false, every
# resource in this module and its submodules is count = 0.
#
# Provider auth:
#   - criblio.onprem (default alias): reads CRIBL_ONPREM_SERVER_URL and
#     CRIBL_BEARER_TOKEN from env (or var.onprem_server_url / var.onprem_bearer_token
#     when provided)
#   - criblio.cloud: OAuth2 client credentials for Cribl.Cloud workspaces
#     (declared but unused until a workspace is provisioned)
